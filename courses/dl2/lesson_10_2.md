## Language Model vs Word2Vec `58:20`
- one question that came up during break was: "How does this compare to word2vec?"
- this is actually a great thing for you to spend time thinking about during the week, is how does this compare to word2vec?
- I'll give you the summary now, but it's a very important conceptual difference
- The main conceptual difference is, what is word2vec?
- **word2vec** is a single embedding matrix.  Each word has a vector and that's it.  So, in other words, it's **a single layer** from a pre-trained model and, specifically, that layer is the input layer
- And also, specifically, that pre-trained model is a linear model, that is pre-trained on something that is called a **co-occurrence** matrix
